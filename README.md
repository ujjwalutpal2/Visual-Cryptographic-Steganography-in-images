# Visual-Cryptographic-Steganography-in-images
In todayâ€™s information age, information sharing, and transfer has increased exponentially. The threat of an intruder accessing secret information has been an ever-existing concern for the data communication experts. Cryptography and steganography are the most widely used techniques to overcome this threat. Cryptography involves converting a message text into an unreadable cipher. On the other hand, steganography embeds message into a cover media and hides its existence. Both these techniques provide some security of data neither of them alone is secure enough for sharing information over an unsecure communication channel and are vulnerable to intruder attacks. In this project we implement an advanced system of encrypting data that combines the features of cryptography, steganography along with multimedia data hiding. This system will be more secure than any other these techniques alone and as compared to steganography and cryptography combined systems. 

# Datasets-requirements
Break Our Steganographic System BOSSBASE: 
It the first scientific challenge conducted to take image steganography from being a research topic to a practical application. The main aim of the competition was to develop a better steganalysis method that can break the steganographic images created by the HUGO (Highly Undetectable stego algorithm. The testing set consists of 1000 grayscale images with dimensions 512X512.

CelebFaces Attributes dataset CELEBA: 
It is a vast dataset with more than 200K images that can be used for face recognition, face detection, face localization and other face-related operations. The dataset consists of images from various sources, locations, background and poses and is best suitable for steganography also.
